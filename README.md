# password-generator-vault
This is the integration of two separate coding tutorials into a single application for ease of use. All credit should go to the respective creators.
The main reason behind this project was to learn a little more about coding with Python when it comes to databases and management of stored information.
I also wanted to have my own 'Password Manager', that doesn't rely on a web connection or any other suspicious or potential risk, with the added benefit
of having a random password generator built-in to save the trouble of coming up with a complex password myself.
